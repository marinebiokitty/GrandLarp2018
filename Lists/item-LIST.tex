%% \prop inside an Item macro labels the card as a prop.  \unstash
%% labels the card as unstashable.  \bulky{n} labels the card as
%% n-hands bulky.  \contain{n} labels the card with n-hands capacity.

%% ItemPacket macros are for item cards with an attached packet.
%% They are a subtype of Item.

%%%%%
%% ItemFold macros are for items represented by just a folded packet.
%% They are a subtype of ItemPacket, with the longer text and ``mark''
%% left blank, since they have no actual item card.
\DECLARESUBTYPE{ItemFold}{ItemPacket}
\PRESETS{ItemFold}{
  \s\MYmark{}

%%%%%
%% ItemEnvelope macros are for items represented by just an envelope.
%% They are a subtype of ItemPacket, with the longer text and ``mark''
%% left blank, since they have no actual item card.
\DECLARESUBTYPE{ItemEnvelope}{ItemPacket}
\PRESETS{ItemEnvelope}{
  \s\MYmark{}

%%%%%
%% ItemLabel macros are for small labels that would get used on
%% physreps, e.g. gun labels.  The ``mark'' is left blank, since
%% it isn't used for these.

%% For \icard, \specialicard, and \itempacket, the optional <extras>

%% \icard[\prop\contain{2}]{..}{..}{..}{..} gives an item that has a
%% prop and 3-hands capacity.

%% The last arg (#5) to \specialicard is for anything extra you may
%% want in the ``mark''
