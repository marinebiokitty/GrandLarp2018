		\item For example, Squad A buffs Squad B in phase 1. In phase 2, Squad B performs an ``Attack'' action. They execute an assisted attack, and add $+1$ for each squad-member since the Summer Contract is in good working order. Lastly, they double their total, to determine the final amount of damage the attack does to their target. However, if Squad B defends in the second phase, then the Buff has no effect.
		\item Initially, only ``Attack'' benefits from ``Buff'', but other unlockable actions may also benefit. If you aren’t sure if ``Buff'' applies, ask a GM.
		\item {\bf If the Autumn Contract is in good working order,} buff may be used {\bf instead} to nullify the next action of a target.
