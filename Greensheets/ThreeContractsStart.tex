Your initial research uncovers mostly just the basics, that most every changeling knows, but may be new and informative for humans and scions.

\emph{Copied from the Setting Document for easy reference:}
\begin{changemargin}{3cm}{3cm}
Each founder forged a powerful contract to protect the University, and wove them together as part of a master contract with the mortal world itself. Cloche's pact, the Brazen Pledge, was forged with bronze, and lent special powers to bronze bells cast using his techniques. Even the smallest bells could sound an alarm of their own volition if a Keeper approached, and do any Keeper within earshot direct harm with the sound of their ringing. The cost of this contract is understood to be that bronze must be used in every structure on campus, and kept carefully polished and maintained. The Autumn founder made a pact with the Leaden Mirror itself, the Galena Compact, to provide information in times of need. The cost of this contract remains entirely unknown to those outside the court, as is fitting of the Autumn Court.

Piper made a bargain with the trees - the Oath of Red Branches. The trees required that anyone who wanted to join the contract must pay with a drop of their own blood. Angered by a century of clearcutting, the forest also demanded that to maintain the contract, the University must never allow axe or saw to fall upon a tree within its grounds. In return, the forest agreed to provide protection from hobgoblins, and to a lesser extent Keepers, to those who carried candles infused with extracts from the trees, or sought safety among them in times of danger.

\emph{New Information:}
\begin{changemargin}{3cm}{3cm}
Professor Yanora, a professor of the history at Wax-Chandler, is cited as the modern day expert on the University contacts. What is particularly noteworthy about this information is that the book was published in 1956, and according to the gremlins, went missing in 1978. Professor Yanora did not join the University until 1992.

\emph{How to continue with this plot:}
\begin{changemargin}{3cm}{3cm}
If you wish to further investigate the the contacts, you must find {\bf Professor Yanora's office} and gain access.  Unfortunately, the professor is not among the PCs so this may be non-trivial.
